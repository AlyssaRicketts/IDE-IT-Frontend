Puja RamanathanCSE 403February 11, 2019Individual Status ReportGoals from a week ago:My plans for the following week include inserting the shortcut tips into the window and giving the user the option to delete a shortcut with an ‘x’. I will work on the functionality of being able to remove suggestions based on if the user clicks the ‘x’ If I finish this, then I will work on adding suggestions dynamically into the window, rather than hardcoding the suggestions into the plugin as it is now. All of this will be done without any of the backend, as this is setting up the visual and interactive aspects of the interface.Progress this week:This week, I wrote our team status report which included our goals, progress, and plans as well as who is responsible for which tasks. I also worked on half of our presentation slides, which included our preliminary results and related work. I met with our front-end team this week to structure our Suggestion objects as well as to display a sample suggestion using this object.Plans for the following week:My plans for the following week will be to add a delete functionality for the tips. Currently, all suggestions in our map are added to the window. I will insert an ‘x’ on each tip line and remove the suggestion if the user clicks on the ‘x’. If I have extra time, I will help research how to enable configurations through the code.
