Individual Status Report 2
IDE-IT Frontend: Rachel Zigman

Goals from Last Week:
-	Implement a working prototype (with no backend connection)
    o	User interface
    o	Mockup list of suggestions
    o	Enable/Disable feature working
-	Begin user testing
-	Work on presentation

Progress from this Week:
This week, I continued to make adjustments in our project proposal based on the 
continued feedback we’ve received. As a team, we read through another groups work 
and I typed up our feedback for them. In the middle of the week we met as a group 
and worked on some implementation details and then discussed plans for the rest 
of the week. After our meeting we had made progress toward having both a checkbox 
with a label and an icon with a label showing up in our plugin window. I was able 
to later fix several bugs and got the icon to show up in the correct location and 
in the correct size. We also realized our goals from last week were very broad and 
a bit too eager, so I also focused on defining more realistic goals.

Plans and Goals for Next Week:
-	Continue implementation
    o	Delete “X” button next to each tip/config option
    o	Mockup list of suggestions
-	Research more about enable/disable feature 
-	Continue user testing
