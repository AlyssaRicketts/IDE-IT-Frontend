Individual Status Report

Goals from last week:
My plans for the following week will be to add a delete functionality for the tips. Currently, all 
suggestions in our map are added to the window. I will insert an x on each tip line and remove 
the suggestion if the user clicks on the x. If I have extra time, I will help research how to enable 
configurations through the code. 

Progress this week:
This week I wrote a portion of our user manual detailing how to use our frontend plugin with 
other backends. I also implemented populating our window with suggestions detected from the 
backend. This involved matching the feature identifier sent by the backend with our map and 
dynamically adding suggestions into the view. I tried using a functional testing tool called 
SWTBot to do UI testing, yet ran into many errors on runtime. I wrote unit tests for the object 
classes we created, namely the Suggestion and Controller objects. I looked into integration 
testing, but this is more complicated than anticipated and most of this testing can also be 
covered by user testing. Lastly, I was able to get our continuous integration running by creating 
a build file and using Travis CI. The only problem I faced with this was importing the backend 
plugin as a dependency in the build file.

Plans for the following week:
My plans for the following week include having a passing build upon integration of the backend 
and working on testing. I will see if I can simulate a user’s behavior in the IDE to see if we are 
receiving the correct feature from the backend and to see that the right suggestion is being 
displayed in the window. I will also help research and implement configuration enabling as well 
as conduct our user testing with the surveys that we create. After the results of the survey, I 
will implement the changes based on the feedback to improve the plugin.
