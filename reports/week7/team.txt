Team Status Report
IDE-IT Frontend 

Last Week’s Goals:
* Add delete functionality via “X” exit buttons to our suggestions in the window
* Coordinate with backend team in preparations of joining the two plugins
    * Implement the interface via registering our plugin as a “suggestionObserver”
    * Create method which will be called when receiving new suggestions that searches the map 
      for the given string and populates the window with corresponding objects
* Decide how to handle errors and multiple repeat suggestions
* Figure out how to enable/disable configurations in IDE

Progress this Week:
* Add an "X" exit button to our suggestions in the window that when clicked removes the suggestion from the window
* Created hotkey composite objects and config composite objects
* Integrate Travis CI with our GitHub repo
* Successfully connected the backend plugin so suggestions now appear in our window when certain actions are taken by the user
* Began to look into how to remove the binding errors that occur when we run plugin.xml (been there since downloaded HelloWorld example)
* Made a lot of progress on changing a preference/configuration when the user clicks the checkbox
* Wrote unit tests for the object classes (Suggestion and Controller objects)
* Began user testing
    * Walking through the product with users
    * Conducting surveys with these participants 


Plans and Goals for Next Week:
* Finish implementing changing a preference on checkbox click
* Create methods with hardcode suggestions to appear at certain times (not relying on backend) to begin user testing
* Work with backend team to utilize gradle or maven to build our system
* Have a passing build upon integration of the backend 
* Continue user testing with more developed product
* Make changes to product based on user feedback

Meeting Agenda:
* Discuss how to make decision on whether to use integration testing or user testing/research
* Discuss how to represent our user research 
    * Since we are conducting surveys how to graph and make reproducible for outside viewers
* Discuss the feasibility of putting our plugin on the eclipse website and how that would change our 
  user manual for users to download it rather than developers
