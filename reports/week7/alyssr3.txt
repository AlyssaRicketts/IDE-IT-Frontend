1. Last Week’s Goals	a. Add an "X" exit button to our suggestions in the window
	b. Begin to coordinate with backend team in preparation of joining the two parts
		i. Implement the interface via registering our plugin as a "suggestionObserver"
		ii. Create method which will be called when receiving new suggestions, that searches the map for the given string and populates the window with the corresponding field object
	c. Decide how to handle errors and multiple repeat suggestions2. Progress This Week
	a. Add an "X" exit button to our suggestions in the window
	b. Created hotkey composite objects and config composite objects
	c. Create listener on exit button to remove suggestion from window when it is clicked
	d. Integrate Travis CI with our GitHub repo
	e. Worked with a member on the backend team to implement the interface between the two plugins
	f. Debug and successfully integrated the two plugins
	g. Began to look into how to remove the binding errors that occur when we run plugin.xml (been there since downloaded HelloWorld example)
	h. Made a lot of progress on changing a preference/configuration when the user clicks the checkbox
		i. Learned how to use the IEclipsePreference API to get and set preferences
		ii. Added a listener to the checkbox button to change the content assist auto activation preference
		iii. Still working on this because it seems to work differently since, when we "run" our xml file, it launches a new Eclipse window and workspace, and changing the properties here is more challenging3. Plans and Goals for Next Week
	a. Finish implementing changing a preference on checkbox click
	b. Create methods which hardcode suggestions to appear at certain times (not relying on backend) to begin user testing
	c. Work with backend team utilize gradle or maven to build our system
