Puja RamanathanCSE 403February 4, 2019Individual Status Report	This week, I worked on our team’s project proposal, the architecture of our system, and started to work on the front-end development of our plug-in. I contributed to the proposal by writing about the costs and how long it will take to build our project. After our initial all-hands meeting, I met with our team to decide the interface, how to organize our repository, and how the backend and frontend teams will interact with each other. Since we are now split separately into these two teams, I created a new mailing list for our frontend team. Then, I started researching Eclipse plugin development so that we could start our side of the project. After Alyssa created the initial sample plugin, I implemented a new window with checkboxes and pushed this to our frontend only repository. I also finished the writeup for Project 3, which outlines the architecture and implementation plan. I created the architecture diagram, wrote about which tools we will use to implement our plan, and determined which members of our team are responsible for which parts of the project.	My plans for the following week include inserting the shortcut tips into the window and giving the user the option to delete a suggestion with an ‘x’. I will work on the functionality of being able to remove suggestions based on if the user clicks the ‘x’. If I finish this, then I will work on adding suggestions dynamically into the window, rather than hardcoding the suggestions into the plugin as it is now. All of this will be done without any of the backend, as this is setting up the visual and interactive aspects of the interface.
