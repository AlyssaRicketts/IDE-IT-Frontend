Individual Status Report 4
IDE-IT Frontend: Rachel Zigman

Plans and Goals from Last Week:
•	Research and implement enable/disable feature
  o	Add hardcoding suggestions that are not dependent on backend
•	Continue user testing with more finished product
  o	Suggestions coming from backend
  o	Checkboxes working
•	Make changes to product based on user feedback

Progress from this Week:
This week I continued to focus on user testing. I reached out to more possible 
participants and had them test our current product and provide feedback in addition 
to filling out our survey. I added to our report an initial results section that 
includes instructions on where to find instructions to reproduce the google survey 
charts and a section about our general feedback and results from our participants. 
I also worked on fixing the formatting of our plugin – for example making the “X” 
look nicer, finding a better lightbulb icon, and adding a vertical scroll bar to fix 
the wrapping around issue we were having with our suggestions in the window. These 
formatting fixes will continue into next week as well. 

Plans and Goals for Next Week:
•	Continue user testing
  o	Make changes to product based on user feedback
•	Continue to fix formatting
•	Add any additional features the backend adds support for
•	Work on finalizing our report
