Rachel Zigman

Plans and Goals from Last Week:
-	Continue to perform more user testing
    o	Make changes to product based on user feedback
-	Continue to fix formatting
-	 Add any additional features the backend adds support for
-	Work on finalizing our report

Progress from this Week:
This week I updated our user survey to include more quesitons about new
features and updated formatting. I have also been updating our report to reflect
updates with our user research as well as continuing to edit from feedback received 
in the past week. I finished up the formatting for the plugin window - this included
updated the lightbulb icon, editing the "X" button, and having the window be scrollable. 
I've also been working on having suggestions appear at the top of the window rather than 
the bottom but this will carry over into our last week.

Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- Have suggestions appear at top of window
- Work on presentation slides and prepare to present
